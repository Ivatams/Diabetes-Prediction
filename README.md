# Diabetes-Prediction
Problem Statement
This project developed a machine learning model from data obtained from the NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) a research Centre that creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The model built was able to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
Dataset Description
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

The task involved data exploration, model building and dashaording to: 
1.	Understand the variables and their corresponding values.	
2.	Visually explore these variables using histograms. Treat the missing values accordingly.
3.	Create scatter charts between the pair of variables to understand the relationships. Describe your findings.
4.	Perform correlation analysis. Visually explore it using a heat map.
5.	Create a classification report by analyzing sensitivity, specificity, AUC (ROC curve), etc. Please be descriptive to explain what values of these parameter you have used.
6.	Create a dashboard in tableau by choosing appropriate chart types and metrics useful for the business.
